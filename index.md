## Project Plan
I am currently planning on working on a software that will allow student to see what classes are availible for them 
to take. I hate it when I have a plan for a schedule ready and when I go to enter it into submitty, I am missing some
pre-req and I have to make a whole new plan. This project might work in conjunction with yacs/ just an idea.
